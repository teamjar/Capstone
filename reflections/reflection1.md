## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 As a team, we were able to completely finish our entire design of our personal dashboard side of the website. We are very close to our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and only need to complete our Stock part of the project. We also completed all of our back-end in terms of post and get requests. Right now we need put and delete requests for some of the end points.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 In terms of challenges, our group had some CSS styling issues while we were working on this project. We had a little bit of a trouble changing the background images but as a team we were able to figure it out.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We did finish all of our tasks for our weekly sprint plan. Our JIRA Board is currently up to date.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources were really helpful for our team as we found ourselves looking back at the old labs and projects that we had completed prior to help us with our project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 There are no current features that we are considering "at risk" since we are currently ahead of our plan of what we were going to have completed this week.
