## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)
  
  The pacing of the project was just right for our team. We accomplished a lot in the alloted time.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

  I think we would have started coding a little earlier. We started at the start of week 7 and I think we would've liked to have started around the end of week 6. We also would have had a ore big schedule on what was a core feature and what was a stretch.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

  The labs were very elpful as they set us up for success. We also found ourselves looking back at the Bank of Codepath as it was similar.


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

  Our mentors were the most helpful as they were able to give us advice as well as help us find the best resources to use during our project journey. We learned a lot from them.
