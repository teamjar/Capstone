## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to get the stock page running with the carousel of images.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We had a few challenges one being on Monday we had an issue showing the graph which caused us to spend the entire day debuging it in order to make it work.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to finish all of the tasks in our sprint plan for this week. We learned a lot and hope to conitnue down this path to improve our functionality.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources were very helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 There are no current "at risk" features.
