## Problem Statement and Description

Insert the latest summary of your problem statement and app description.

### Problem Statement:

We struggle to quickly and accurately assess our company's financial health due to the lack of real-time financial data.

The process of compiling financial reports is time-consuming, leaving little time for analysis.

We lack a centralized location for key financial metrics, leading to disconnected decision-making processes.

We're struggling to understand the impact of different business areas on our financial performance due to disparate data sources.

I'm having trouble keeping track of all my income and expenses. I need a centralized place where I can see everything in one go.

I struggle to set and maintain a budget. I need a tool that can help me set realistic budget goals and track my progress.

I find it hard to visualize my spending patterns. I need a tool that can present my financial data in an easy-to-understand way.

I frequently forget to pay bills on time. I need a system that reminds me when payments are due.

### Description

Financial Dashboard: Fetches and displays real-time data, including stock prices, Forex rates, commodity prices, and other relevant financial data. Including features like portfolio management, personalized notifications, and trend analysis.
